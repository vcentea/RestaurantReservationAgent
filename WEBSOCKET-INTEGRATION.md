# WebSocket Integration for Real-Time Voice Communication

## Overview

We've started implementing real-time audio streaming between Twilio and ElevenLabs for more natural restaurant reservation calls. This document outlines the architecture and implementation progress.

## Architecture

The WebSocket integration enables real-time audio streaming between Twilio's phone system and ElevenLabs' Voice Agent API:

1. **Twilio Connection**: When a call is established with a restaurant, Twilio opens a WebSocket connection to our server.
2. **ElevenLabs Connection**: Our server connects to ElevenLabs' Voice Agent API.
3. **Audio Relay**: Our server acts as a bridge, relaying audio data between Twilio and ElevenLabs.
4. **Conversation Status**: ElevenLabs sends control messages to update the reservation status.

## Implementation Status

We've started implementing the WebSocket server in `server/services/websocket.ts` with:

- Server initialization
- Connection handling for both Twilio and ElevenLabs
- Audio data relay between both services
- Status update events to record reservation outcomes
- Function calling interface for the ElevenLabs agent to query restaurant information

## Implementation Challenges

There are some TypeScript and configuration issues to resolve:

1. **WebSocket Type Definitions**: The `ws` package types need adjustment to work properly.
2. **Server Configuration**: The WebSocket server needs to be properly integrated with the Express HTTP server.
3. **Message Handling**: Complex message handling patterns for different data types.

## Next Steps

To complete the WebSocket integration:

1. Fix TypeScript type issues in the WebSocket implementation
2. Ensure proper error handling and connection lifecycle management
3. Set up proper testing with both Twilio and ElevenLabs endpoints
4. Integrate with the main call flow

## Integration with Existing System

Once completed, this will enhance our current simulation approach with:

- Real-time voice conversations instead of simulated exchanges
- Lower latency for agent responses
- More natural conversation flow
- Better handling of complex reservation scenarios

## Usage with ElevenLabs Voice Agent

The WebSocket integration is designed to work with the existing ElevenLabs Voice Agent (ID: 9XjNNhNDWGsAPGfwiEq9) configured for restaurant bookings.
